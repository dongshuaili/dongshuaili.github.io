It has been suggested that the electromagnetic radiation from the discharges may be powerful enough to excite elves, the rapidly expanding rings of luminous emissions at the bottom ionosphere. Here we present optical observations by ASIM and simultaneous radio measurements by lightning receivers in China, that confirm this proposition. The concurrent measurements suggest that corona discharges at cloud tops generate elves observable by ASIM when the peak current exceeds ∼140 kA in absolute value, as estimated from the NBE measurements. The appearance of elves offers an alternate method to estimate the corona discharge currents and alignments at cloud tops, relevant to the characterization of chemical perturbations to greenhouse gas agents at the tropical tropopause.},

  abstract     = {Blue corona discharges are often generated in thunderclouds penetrating into the stratosphere and are the optical manifestation of narrow bipolar events (NBEs) observed in radio signals. While their production appears to depend on convection, the cause and nature of such discharges are not well known. Here we show the observations by a lightning detection array of unusual amounts of 982 NBEs during a tropical storm on the coastline of China. NBEs of negative polarity are predominantly observed at the cloud top reaching the stratosphere, and positive NBEs are primarily at lower altitudes. We find that the dominant polarity changes with the typical time of development of thunderstorm cells, suggesting that the polarity depends on the phase of the storm cells. Furthermore, we find that the lightning jump of negative NBEs is associated with above-anvil cirrus plumes of ice crystals and water vapor in the lower stratosphere. We propose that variations in updrafts induce changes in the altitude and charge concentrations of the cloud layers, which lead to the polarity transition. Our results have implications for studies of the chemical perturbations of greenhouse gas concentrations by corona discharges at the tropopause.},

This paper investigates the effect of the slanted NBEs using a newly developed rebounding-wave model. The modeling results are validated against the full-wave Finite- Difference Time-Domain method and compared with measurements for both vertical and slanted NBE cases. It is found that the inclination of the NBEs affects both the waveforms and amplitudes of the electrostatic, induction and radiation components of the electric fields at close distances (≤10 km). However, it primarily influences the amplitudes of the fields for distances beyond 50 km, where the radiation component dominates, resulting in changes of ≥30\% when the slant angle exceeds 30°. The slanted rebounding-wave model improves the agreement with respect to a purely vertical channel and can be extended to any discharge geometry at arbitrary observation distances.},

Although we know they often correlate with Narrow Bipolar Events (NBEs) in Very Low Frequency/Low Frequency radio signals, their physics is not well understood. Here, we report a detailed analysis of different types of blue corona discharges observed by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor during an overpass of a thundercloud cell nearby Malaysia. Both single- and multi-pulse blue corona discharges were associated with positive NBEs at the top of the cloud, reaching about 18 km altitude. We find that the primary pulses of multi-pulse discharges have weaker current moments than the single-pulse discharges, suggesting that the multi-pulse discharges either have shorter vertical channels or have weaker currents than the single-pulse discharges. The subsequent pulse trains of the multi-pulse discharges delayed some milliseconds are likely from horizontally oriented electrical discharges, but some NBEs, correlated with both single-and multi-pulse discharges, include small-amplitude oscillations within a few microseconds inside their waveforms, which are unresolved in the optical observation and yet to be understood. Furthermore, by jointly analyzing the optical and radio observations, we estimate the photon free mean path at the cloud top to be ∼6 m.},

By monitoring optical emissions from thunderstorms, the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) onboard the International Space Station is providing new clues about lightning initiation by detecting Blue LUminous Events (BLUEs), which are manifestations of electrical corona discharges that sometimes precedes lightning. Here we combine optical and radio observations from a thunderstorm near Malaysia to uncover a new type of event containing multiple optical and radio pulses. We find that the first optical pulse coincides with a strong radio signal in the form of a Narrow Bipolar Event (NBE) but subsequent optical pulses, delayed some milliseconds, have weaker radio signals, possibly because they emanate from a horizontally oriented electrical discharges which does not trigger full-fledged lightning. Our results cast light on the differences between isolated and lightning-initiating electrical discharges.},

One with fast rise times of 30 μs or less that are relatively unaffected by cloud scattering and emanate from within ∼2 km of the cloud tops, and another with longer rise times from deeper within the clouds. 50\% of cells generating shallow events are associated with overshooting tops compared to 34\% of cells generating deeper events.

In this study, we investigate fast breakdown using different approaches that employ a Modified Transmission Line with Exponential decay (MTLE) model and propose a new model, named “rebounding MTLE model,” which reproduces the secondary fast breakdown current in NBEs.

The gamma-ray production in these TGFs preceded the occurrence of NBEs by a minimum of 60 µs up to 13.5 ms, and no other fast leader discharge was found within 20 ms before the TGF. The TGF-preceded positive NBEs occurred at altitudes of 8.6–11 km in thunderstorms, likely in the high electric field (E-field) region of lightning initiation. The analyses show that the NBE-preceding TGFs bear harder energy spectrum with larger proportion of high-energy photons than EIP-related TGFs produced in association with lightning leader. Our findings support the relativistic feedback mechanism of gamma-ray generation in the large-scale thunderstorm E-field.},

The rise times of the emissions for negative NBEs are about 10 μs, consistent with source locations at cloud tops where photons undergo little scattering by cloud particles, and for positive NBEs are ~1 ms, consistent with locations deeper in the clouds.

  abstract     = {Abstract Narrow bipolar events (NBEs) (also called narrow bipolar pulses [NBPs] or compact intracloud discharges [CIDs]) are energetic intracloud discharges characterized by narrow bipolar electromagnetic waveforms identified from ground-based very low frequency (VLF)/low-frequency (LF) observations. The simplified ray-theory method proposed by Smith et al. (1999, https://doi.org/10.1029/1998JD200045; 2004, https://doi.org/10.1029/2002RS002790) is widely used to infer the altitude of intracloud lightning and the effective (or virtual) reflection height of the ionosphere from VLF/LF signals. However, due to the large amount of high-frequency components in NBEs, the propagation effect of the electromagnetic fields for NBEs at large distance depends nontrivially on the geometry and the effective conductivity of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide (EIWG). In this study, we investigate the propagation of NBEs by using a full-wave Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) approach. The simulated results are compared with ground-based measurements at different distances in Southern China, and we assess the accuracy of the simplified ray-theory method in estimating the altitude of the NBE source and the effective reflection height of the ionosphere. It is noted that the evaluated NBE altitudes have a slight difference of about ±1 km when compared with the full-wave FDTD results, while the evaluated ionospheric reflection heights are found to be bigger than those obtained from FDTD model by about 5 km.},

  abstract     = {Abstract While narrow bipolar events (NBEs) could be related with lightning initiation, their intrinsic physics remains in question. Here we report on optical measurements by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) on the International Space Station (ISS) of blue flashes associated with NBEs. They are observed in a narrow blue band centered at 337 nm, with no simultaneous activity at 777.4 nm, considered a strong lightning emission line. From radio waves measured from the ground, we find that 7 of 10 single-pulse blue events can be identified as positive NBEs. The source altitudes estimated from optical and radio signals agree and indicate that the sources of the blue flashes are located between ∼8.5 and ∼14 km, in a cloud reaching 14–15 km altitude. The observations suggest that single-pulse blue flashes are from cold ionization waves, so-called streamers, and that positive NBEs are corona discharges formed by many streamers.},

In the model, we investigate the effect of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide structure and medium parameters, including the effect of the ionospheric cold plasma characteristics, the effect of the Earth curvature, and the propagation effects over mountainous terrain. For the first time, the obtained results are validated against simultaneous experimental data consisting of lightning currents measured at the Säntis Tower and electric fields measured in Neudorf, Austria, located at 380-km distance from the tower. It is shown that both the time delays and amplitudes of the lightning electromagnetic fields at 380-km distance can be strongly affected by the ionospheric electron density profile, the mountainous terrain, and the Earth curvature. After taking into account the effect of the irregular terrain between the Säntis Tower and the field measurement station, the vertical electric fields calculated by using our model are found to be in good agreement with the corresponding measured cases occurred in both daytime and nighttime. The ideal approximation used in either the classical solutions or the simplified models might lead to inaccuracies in the estimated reflection height. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of our results by considering different return stroke models, as well as different typical values of the return stroke speed and of the ground conductivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract In this paper, we analyze the location error of time of arrival (ToA)-based lightning location systems (LLSs) caused by propagation effects over mountainous terrain around the Säntis tower located in the Swiss Alps. The study is based on a full-wave three-dimensional (3-D) finite difference time domain approach using the topographic map including the Säntis tower and the nearby sensors belonging to LLSs. It is found that the vertical electric fields are strongly affected by the presence of the mountainous terrain and the finite ground conductivity and that the location error associated with the ToA technique depends strongly on the used onset time estimation technique. The evaluated location errors associated with amplitude thresholds of 10\% and 20\% and the time of the linear extrapolation of the tangent at maximum field derivative are found to be smallest (about 300 m or less). Finally, we assess the accuracy of two simplified methods (terrain envelope method and tight-terrain-fit method) to account for the location error due to propagation over mountainous terrain. These two methods might represent an efficient alternative to estimate the additional time delay due to propagation over a nonflat terrain by using available topographic data. In addition, a possible real-time location error compensation algorithm using the elongated propagation path method to improve the location error of the LLSs in mountainous regions is presented and discussed.},

To the best of our knowledge, the dataset presented in this study includes the first simultaneous records of lightning currents and associated fields featuring ionospheric reflections for natural upward flashes, and the longest distance at which natural upward lightning fields have been measured simultaneously with their causative currents. The intervals between the groundwave and skywave arrival times are used to estimate ionospheric reflection heights during day and night times using the so-called zero-to-zero and peak-to-peak methods. During daytime, the mean ionospheric reflection heights, obtained using the two different delay estimation approaches, are about 78 and 76 km, corresponding to the D layer. The mean reflection height at nighttime is about 90 and 89 km, corresponding to the E layer. We present a full-wave, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis of the electric field propagation including the effect of the ionospheric reflections. The FDTD simulation results are compared with the measured fields associated with upward flashes initiated from the Säntis Tower.

We also discuss the time delay error in the time-of-arrival (ToA) technique currently used to locate lightning in detection networks, specifically. Furthermore, the accuracy of different approximate methods presented in the literature is discussed and tested by using our 3-D FDTD method. It is found that (1) the time delays and amplitudes of the lightning-radiated electromagnetic fields can be significantly affected by the presence of a mountainous terrain and associated diffraction phenomena; (2) for a finitely conducting ground, the time delay shows a slight increase with the increase of the observation distance, but the time delay resulting from the finite ground conductivity appears to be smaller than that caused by the mountainous terrain; and (3) the timing error associated with the ToA technique depends on the threshold times. Threshold times of 10\% and 20\% of the peak provide very similar results compared to those corresponding to the peak of the first derivative of the magnetic field, and the threshold time exceeds 50\% of the initial rising amplitude of the signal. Furthermore, we have assessed the accuracy of two simplified methods (terrain-envelope method and tight-terrain fit method) to account for the time delays resulting from the propagation in a mountainous terrain. It is found that both methods result in time delays that are in reasonable agreement but always overestimating the results obtained using the full-wave 3-D FDTD approach for the perfectly conducting ground. These two methods represent interesting alternatives to account for the time delay over a nonflat terrain using the terrain model.},

When the conductivity of the first layer (σ1 = 0.001 S/m, εr1 = 10) is less than that of the second layer ( σ2 = 0.1 S/m, εr2 = 10), the lightning-induced overvoltage increases obviously with the increase of the depth of the first layer due to the increase of the total effective impedance, and we should consider the influence of the stratified ground if the depth of the first layer is more than 2 m. However, the lightning-induced overvoltage decreases sharply with the increase of first layer depth with much higher conductivity ( σ1 = 0.1 S/m, εr1 = 10; σ2 = 0.001 S/m, εr2 = 10).

When the ground conductivity near the observation point is less than that near the strike point, it is noted that the C-R formula predicts a satisfactory accuracy in the initial several microseconds after the beginning of the return stroke. However, when the ground conductivity near the observation point is larger than that near the strike point, the initial negative excursion predicted by the C-R formula is underestimated, and the error increases with the increase of the difference between the two sections conductivity.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Blue corona discharges are often observed at the top of thunderclouds. They are bursts of streamers, but the cloud conditions that enable them are not well known. Here we present observations by the Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM) of 92 discharges during its ∼1 min pass over tropical cyclone Fani in the Bay of Bengal from 20:10:55 to 20:12:05 UTC on 30 April 2019. The discharges were observed in convective cells forming in the rainbands of the cyclone where Convective Available Potential Energy reached ∼6,000 J kg−1. The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation satellite passed over one of the cells ∼12 min after ASIM from 20:23:58 to 20:24:14 UTC. It measured the cloud microphysics related to the discharges and indicated they occurred in a convection region with the cloud top overshooting for over 20 min. The updraft lifted ice particles to lower stratospheric altitudes and formed the gullwing-shaped cirrus. The discharges are found at an average altitude of ∼16 km where the cloud environment contained ∼2 × 107 m−3 ice particles with ∼50 µm radius, resulting in a photon mean free path of ∼3 m. Around 20\% of the blue corona discharges coincide with Narrow Bipolar Events indentified from the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network. Our observations suggest that the overshooting cloud top formed by deep convection and a surge in lightning activity facilitated conditions for the blue corona discharges. This work provides the first-ever estimate of important microphysical parameters related to blue corona discharges based on data measurements, establishing a reference for future empirical and theoretical studies.},

  abstract     = {Abstract We present nighttime worldwide distributions of key features of Blue LUminous Events (BLUEs) detected by the Modular Multispectral Imaging Array of the Atmosphere-Space Interaction Monitor. Around 10\% of all detected BLUEs exhibit an impulsive single pulse shape. The rest of BLUEs are unclear (impulsive or not) single, multiple or with ambiguous pulse shapes. BLUEs exhibit two distinct populations with peak power density <25 µWm−2 (common) and ≥25 µWm−2 (rare) with different rise times and durations. The altitude (and depth below cloud tops) zonal distribution of impulsive single pulse BLUEs indicate that they are commonly present between cloud tops and a depth of ≤4 km in the tropics and ≤1 km in mid and higher latitudes. Impulsive single pulse BLUEs in the tropics are the longest (up to ∼4 km height) and have the largest number of streamers (up to ∼3 × 109). Additionally, the analysis of BLUEs has turned out to be particularly complex due to the abundance of radiation belt particles (at high latitudes and in the South Atlantic Anomaly [SAA]) and cosmic rays all over the planet. True BLUEs can not be fully distinguished from radiation belt particles and cosmic rays unless other ground-based measurements associated with the optically detected BLUEs are available. Thus, the search algorithm of BLUEs presented in Soler et al. (2021), https://doi.org/10.1029/2021gl094657 is now completed with a new additional step that, if used, can considerably smooth the SAA shadow but can also underestimate the number of BLUEs worldwide.},

As the altitude increases, the maximum strength of electrostatic and induction field gradually decreases, and the induction field decays slower than electrostatic field above 80â€¯km. The electrostatic and induction field in the region of halo formation have a much larger contribution to the total E-field than the radiation field. Therefore, it is proposed that in addition to the electrostatic field, the induction field (with amplitude more than half of total E-field) is the main component of the total E-field within the first half millisecond directly above the stroke. Our analysis indicates that the induction field might play a significant role in the halo formation and probably also the sprite initiation. The M-component, the longer rising edge, the wavy long tail, and the relatively long time scale of stroke current can increase the amplitude of electrostatic and induction field at the height of halos, and drive the occurrence of halos and the subsequent development of streamers, therefore forming sprites. Our results enrich the understanding on the mechanism of halo production and the lightning electromagnetic field in the middle and high-altitude atmosphere, and also pave the way for future accurate modeling of halo formation.},

The flash contains 23 negative strokes and one positive stroke. The intervals between the groundwave and skywave arrival times are used to estimate ionospheric reflection heights for the negative return strokes using the so-called zero-to-zero and peak-to-peak methods. A full-wave, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis of the electric field propagation including the effect of the ionospheric reflections is also presented. FDTD simulation results are compared with the measured radiated electric field associated with the studied flash to evaluate the reference reflection height of the conductivity profile. It is also found that the ratio of the peak field to the current peak is about two times smaller for the positive pulse compared to negative pulses. This difference in the amplitudes can be attributed to a lower return stroke speed for the positive stroke compared to that for negative strokes, and also to the fact that the enhancement of the electric field due to the presence of the tower and the mountain might be more significant for negative pulses, which are characterized by faster risetimes compared to the positive one.},

Two sensors were deployed, one at 1-m height above ground and another one at 2-m depth underground at a distance of 78 m from the lightning channel, and the magnetic pulses during the initial stage of triggered lightning were recorded. The experimental results show that the microsecond-scale magnetic pulses radiated by the upward lightning leader can be detected in the subsurface space and the magnetic signal is modified by the soil medium. Specifically, the amplitude at the depth of 2 m is attenuated typically more than 55\%, and the attenuation decreases as the timescale of the magnetic pulse increases; meanwhile, the peak time of the underground magnetic pulse is delayed by about 0.6 μs, and the half-peak width of the magnetic pulse is increased by 0.2–0.8 μs (namely, by 20\% to 32\%). The results of Fourier analysis indicate that the component with relatively high frequency is subject to more attenuation than is the component with relatively low frequency. In addition, the simulation of magnetic field with the channel-base current by using the transmission line model is consistent with the measurement, indicating that the modification on the waveform characteristics of the lightning pulse measured underground could provide valuable information for retrieving the electromagnetic parameters of soil.},

In this study, we propose a simplified cloud scattering light model to analyze the influence of inhomogeneities in the cloud microphysical properties on the observations of blue corona discharges (BLUEs) from Atmosphere-Space Interactions Monitor. The results show that the depth inferred from the inhomogeneous model is consistently lower than that from the homogeneous model, with the largest difference reaching 2 km. We then present a new approach to inferring inhomogeneous cloud microphysical profiles based on the optical signals from BLUEs using radio-inferred source depths. These profiles match well with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation lidar measurements and show a transition nearby tropopause with different exponential change rates above and below it. Our study highlights the potential of combining optical and radio observations of BLUEs to rapidly assess cloud microphysics and monitor convective activity.},
